## Importance: 
I just updated this project completely in the new repo: HybridRAG-paper-recommendation-system. This repo will be deleted in the near future.
## 🌟 Overview

An intelligent paper discovery system that automatically downloads new research papers weekly, processes their content using LLM, and delivers personalized recommendations to users based on their research interests. The system combines automated paper collection, content extraction, vector database storage, and hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for intelligent paper matching and notification.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Automated Paper Collection**: Weekly downloads of new research papers from various sources
- **📄 Advanced Content Extraction**: Utilizes Grobid for accurate paper information extraction
- **🗄️ Vector Database Storage**: Stores paper embeddings and metadata in Milvus for efficient retrieval
- **🎯 Personalized Recommendations**: Hybrid RAG system matches papers to user interests
- **📧 Email Notifications**: Automated delivery of relevant papers to subscribers
- **🌐 Web Interface**: User-friendly platform for topic subscription and paper browsing
